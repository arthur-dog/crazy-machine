# 🌀 Crazy Machine

Welcome to the **Crazy Machine** project for CMPE3006!

This repository contains both the Arduino and VHDL codebases used in our project. The goal is to maintain clear organization and support fast, efficient collaboration.

## 🚀 Collaboration Guidelines

To ensure smooth teamwork:

- ✅ **Commit, pull, and push frequently** to keep everyone on the same page.
- 🌿 **Create a branch** for any experimental or testing-specific changes. Once stable, we can discuss merging them into the main codebase.
- 💬 If you have questions about Git or collaboration workflows, feel free to reach out to Ada — they are happy to help!

> *Let’s keep the momentum going and build something awesome!*
