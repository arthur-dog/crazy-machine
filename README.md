# crazy-machine
Repo for CMPE3006 Crazy Machine project. 

## Structure
The worktrees for the Arduino code and the VHDL code will be kept in the `src/arduino` and `src/vhdl` folders respectively, with their documentation located in the `doc` directory. 
The purpose of keeping these projects in the same repo is to enable rapid collaboration. **Please commit and push/pull frequently** to ensure that everyone is working on the same page. If you are working on a special change, like a change to a module's function for testing purposes and you still wish to commit and share progress with everyone, please *create a branch*. If we want to integrate this change, we can merge it. I am well acquainted with git, and so if you have questions about using it don't hesitate to ask me. - Ada
